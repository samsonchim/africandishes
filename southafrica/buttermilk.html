        <h2>Buttermilk Rusks "KarringmelkBeskuit" </h2>
        <i>"This is a traditional rusk - great for dunking in your tea or coffee early in the morning when you
            watch the sun rise as the "Boer trekkers or Voortrekkers" did every morning when they
            travelled from the Cape to the Transvaal."</i>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>375g butter</li>
            <li>500g sugar</li>

            <li>2 extra-large eggs</li>
            <li>1,5kg self-rising flour</li>
            <li>30ml (2 tablespoons) baking powder</li>
            <li>500ml (2 cups) buttermilk or plain drinking yogurt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions on how to make it</h2>
        <ol>
            Cream the butter and sugar together very well. Add the eggs, one at a time. Sift the flour and
baking powder together, and add this to the creamed mixture, using a fork to mix. Add the
buttermilk or yogurt, using a little milk to rinse out the carton. Mix well with a fork and then
knead lightly. Pack lightly rolled, golf ball sized buns of the dough into the greased bread pans
close together, and bake for 45-55 minutes. Place the pans in the middle of the oven, with a
sheet of brown paper on the top shelf to protect the buns from becoming browned too quickly.
Remove the paper after the buns are well risen and cooked through, to brown the tops.
Reduce the heat to the lowest possible setting. Turn out the buns on to cake racks, cool them
and separate them, using 2 forks. Pack them on wire racks or on cooled oven racks - air must
circulate. Place them in the cool oven, leaving the door ajar, for 4-5 hours, or overnight, to dry
out

            <b>Tips:</b>
            <ul>
                <li>If the rusks are to be kept for a long time, do not substitute margarine for the butter.
                    If no buttermilk or yogurt is available, use fresh milk curdled with lemon juice or white
                    vinegar</li>
