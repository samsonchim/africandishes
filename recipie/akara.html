    <h2>AKARA</h2>
    <i>"Akara is a deep fried food made from puréed
        beans. It is usually made with 4 ingredients;
        beans, salt, pepper and onions. It is similar to
        moin-moin since puréed beans is the base but
        moin-moin is either steamed or baked and has
        a lot more ingredients and they definitely taste
        different. Both dishes taste delicious and are
        enjoyed with pap, bread or garri" <br>-

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups black eyed peas or honey beans
        (cleaned, soaked and skin peeled for 1 -2hrs)
        </li>
    <li>1 habanero pepper</li>

        <li>Salt or seasoning powder to taste</li>
            <li>3/4 cup of water</li>
                <li>3 cups cooking oil (for deep frying)</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer the soaked beans into a blender, add
            onions, pepper and water. Blend until smooth.</li>
<br>
        <li>Transfer the batter into the bowl of a stand mixer,
            add salt, then whisk for about 6 minutes to
            incorporate air into the mixture.</li>
<br>
        <li>Heat up the oil for frying. When the oil is hot,
            carefully scoop the batter into the oil with your hand
            [or a table spoon]. Do not crowd the pan.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Fry until golden brown. Remember to flip the akara
            to ensure that the akara balls are evenly brown </li>
<br>       

<li>Transfer to a frying basket lined with kitchen paper
    towel to absorb any excess oil.</li>
<br>       
      
    </ol>

    <b>Tips:</b>
    <ul>
    <li>Soaking the beans softens it and makes it easier
    to blend. For best results, you need to use a
    powerful blender <br>
    <li>Do not skip the whisking stage. If you don't have
    a stand mixer, you can use a hand mixer or a
    whisk <br>
    <li>You can also stir batter in a circular motion
    continuously with a spatula <br>
    <li>Oil temperature test: Put a slice of onion into the
    oil, if it bubbles and comes up immediately, then
    the oil is ready to fry the akara. The oil needs to
    be hot enough to prevent the akara from
    absorbing too much oil </li>
