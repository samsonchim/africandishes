    <h2>MOIN-MOIN AND EKO TUTU</h2>
    <i>Moin-Moin, also known as steamed bean pudding is a Nigerian bean delicacy. It is made with either
        brown beans, black eyed beans or lentils. Moin-Moin can be hob steamed or oven steamed, though
        the hob steamed method is much more popular than the oven steamed moin-moin. It can be made
        with either vegetable/sunflower or palm oil or a mixture of both. Moin-Moin can either be steamed
        in banana leaves, foil containers, plastic/freezer bags, ramekins or even old/baking tins. Moin-Moin
        can be made with several fillings like corned beef, boiled or smoked fish, shredded beef/chicken,
        smoked/fresh shrimps"<br>-

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <b>TO PREPARE EKO TUTU (CORN PAP)</b>
    <ol>
        <li>Transfer the soaked beans into a blender, add
            onions, pepper and water. Blend until smooth.</li>
<br>
        <li>Transfer the batter into the bowl of a stand mixer,
            add salt, then whisk for about 6 minutes to
            incorporate air into the mixture.</li>
<br>
        <li>Heat up the oil for frying. When the oil is hot,
            carefully scoop the batter into the oil with your hand
            [or a table spoon]. Do not crowd the pan.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Fry until golden brown. Remember to flip the akara
            to ensure that the akara balls are evenly brown </li>
<br>       

<li>Transfer to a frying basket lined with kitchen paper
    towel to absorb any excess oil.</li>
<br>       
      
    </ol>
    <i>
    <b>Tips:</b>
    <li>Soaking the beans softens it and makes it easier
    to blend. For best results, you need to use a
    powerful blender <br>
    <li>Do not skip the whisking stage. If you don't have
    a stand mixer, you can use a hand mixer or a
    whisk <br>
    <li>You can also stir batter in a circular motion
    continuously with a spatula <br>
    <li>Oil temperature test: Put a slice of onion into the
    oil, if it bubbles and comes up immediately, then
    the oil is ready to fry the akara. The oil needs to
    be hot enough to prevent the akara from
    absorbing too much oil </li>
