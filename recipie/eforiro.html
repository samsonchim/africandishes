    <h2>EFO RIRO</h2>
    <i>'Efo riro' is a delicacy with its origins in the South-West
        part of Nigeria. 'Efo' can be referred to as ‘green leafy
        vegetable’, and ‘riro’ is a word from the Yoruba language,
        meaning ‘to stir'. So simply put, efo riro is mixed-strirred
        leafy vegetables. Efo riro in all its glory is a healthy
        vegetable soup because it contains various nutritional
        ingredients. For instance, the leafy vegetable is rich in
        vitamins and antioxidants, while the locust beans used in
        its preparation also contains protein and lipids which aid
        energy storage and cell building in our bodies.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <p>Efo riro can be whipped up in a few short minutes
        once all ingredients are available. (Feel free to mix
        up your ingredients). Boil meat and set aside. I
        usually like to cut these into small edible bites. I
        then put the pot or saucepan on fire and heat up
        the palm oil (no bleaching please). I chop a bit of
        onions into the oil and fry for a few seconds, after
        which I add the coarsely blended peppers, meat
        stock, ponmo and locust beans to fry, until water
        evaporates from the sauce and the ponmo is
        cooked. Next is to add the meat, smoked fish,
        crayfish, seasoning powder and salt to taste and
        allow it to cook until the meat has absorbed the
        sauce. I must mention here that I usually blanch my
        shredded leafy vegetable in hot water followed
        almost immediately with a dip in very cold water
        then drained. Once the meat and others are well
        cooked in the sauce, I stir in the vegetables, leave it
        to simmer while stirring for a few minutes and
        voila! Efo riro is ready! Efo riro can generally be
        eaten with all sorts of swallows, rice, and boiled
        plantain. I particularly love to have mine with moinmoin.
