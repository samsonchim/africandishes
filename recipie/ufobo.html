    <h2>UFOBO MMONG BIA OR UKOM (YAM OR PLANTAIN PEPPERSOUP) </h2>
    <i>This is a broth (pepper soup) prepared
        with goat meat or other meat of choice
        like chicken or fish. It is usually made to
        be a bit spicy and is a great meal to have in
        a cold season. It is also good for people
        recovering from a cold or flu. The yam or
        plantain makes it filling. It is also
        important to mention that the goat that is
        smoked is the common variety used for
        this meal, as opposed to the one scraped
        with a razor blade. The smoked one adds a
        distinct barbecue flavour to the pepper
        soup.</i>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut yam (or plantain) into thick cubes, wash and put aside</li>
<br>
        <li>Wash the goat meat throughly and put in a pot to boil. Blend
            the onion and fresh pepper together and add to the boiling
            meat. Add 2 stock cubes and salt. Allow the meat to start
            cooking in its own juices. This is to allow the absorption of
            flavours into the meat before adding water. Add more water
            when the stock reduces. Allow to cook for about 20 minutes or
            till tender. Add some dry yellow pepper for flavour, peppersoup
            spices and an additional stock cube.
            </li>
<br>
        <li>While boiling, add your yam (or plantain) and cook together till
            the yam is soft. The yam cooks quickly, that is why you donâ€™t
            add it at the beginning</li>
    </li>
            <br>
        <li>Add sliced ntong and taste for salt. Adjust accordingly.
            Continue cooking for about 3 minutes and your ufobo mmong
            bia is ready. </li>

    <b>Indy's tips:</b>
    For the pepper soup to cook quicker, it is
    advisable to use the male variety of the
    goat for your cooking. It gets tender
    faster than the female variety and
    provides great aroma.</i>
