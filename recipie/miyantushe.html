    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Slice 1 onion and 2 scotch bonnet peppers, and set aside.
        </li>
<br>
        <li>On low-medium heat, in a large stock pot, braise the
            lamb/goat meat with the sliced onions, scotch bonnet
            peppers, 1 tsp bullion and 1 tsp salt for 30 minutes or until
            the meat is tender.</li>
<br>
        <li>While the meat is braising, blend the tomatoes, bell pepper,
            1 onion, and two scotch bonnet peppers. Place the blended
            tomato mix in a pot and cook on medium heat until the
            sauce reduces down to a thick paste. You might need to
            reduce the heat to prevent the tomato paste from burning.
            </li>
<br>
        <li>Once the meat is tender and done braising, add in the
            pumpkin chunks and 2 cups of water into the pot with the
            braised meat. The water should just cover the pumpkin
            chunks and meat. At this stage, adjust the seasoning of the
            broth and water to the pumpkins. Cover and boil for 15
            minutes or until the pumpkin is tender.</li>
<br>
        <li>While the pumpkin are cooking, grind the peanuts in a
            blender, food processor, or with a mortar an pestle until it
            forms a rough paste, and set aside.
            </li>
<br>
        <li>Once the pumpkins are tender, use the back of a spoon to
            smash the pumpkin chunks. Add in the crushed peanuts,
            tomato paste, cray fish, and stir the stew. Cover and cook
            for 5 minutes on low- medium heat.</li>
<br>
        <li>After the stew has cooked for 5 minutes, add in the palm oil,
            chopped spinach and chopped sorrel, and cook the stew
            covered for 10 minutes on low heat.
            
        </li>
<br>
        <li>After 10 minutes, taste the stew for seasoning and adjust the
            salt if necessary. Turn the heat off and allow the stew to sit
            for 5 minutes. Serve hot.
