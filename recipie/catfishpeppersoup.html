    <h2>CATFISH
        PEPPERSOUP</h2>
    <i>"Nigerians love pepper soup, it is the spicy broth
        of meat or fish with some bitter herb added.
        Catfish pepper soup is always high in demand by
        guests at Nigerian parties, and is about the most
        common pepper soup cooked in Nigeria homes,
        pubs, restaurants etc. Catfish pepper soup is
        called 'point-and-kill' in drinking parlours. The
        combination of spices, pepper and herbs is
        delectable and gives a feeling of wellbeing after
        having a bowl of pepper soup"

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    </li>
      <li>1 red onion</li>
      <li>2- 3 scotch bonnet pepper</li>
      <li>1 ½ tbsp of ground crayfish</li>
      <li>Black pepper</li>
      <li>1 ½ tsp of uziza leaves
    </li>
      <li>1 tsp of ground pepper soup or banga soup spices</li>
      <li>3 bay leaves</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To clean catfish, place fish in a bowl, add salt
            and hot water. The slimy skin will come off and it
            will kill any unwanted bacteria. Repeat process 3
            times, rinse off with cold water and set aside.</li>
<br>
        <li>Place cleaned catfish in cooking pot. Blend
            scotch bonnet and red onion with very little
            water and add to pot. Add 4- 5 cups of water,
            depending on the quantity of soup needed. 5 is
            ideal because the liquid will reduce later on.</li>
<br>
        <li>Add ground crayfish, black pepper, bay leaves,
            seasoning cubes and salt. Cover and cook on
            medium high heat for about 15 to 20 minutes. All
            ingredients will have mixed together, and the
            soup will become light brown in colour. Add salt
            according to preference and also you can reduce
            the amount of scotch bonnet pepper used if you
            do not like a lot of spicy heat</li>
<br>
        <li>Reduce cooking heat to low medium and stir.
            Stir carefully to not break the fish into pieces.
            You can hold both pot handles and gently shake
            the pot to stir. Taste for seasoning and adjust if
            needed, by adding only salt or one seasoning
            cube.
            </li>
<br>
        <li>Add more water, if you need more soup/liquid.
            If you added more water, adjust seasoning with
            ½ a teaspoon of ground crayfish, one seasoning
            cube. Cover and cook for an additional 7- 10
            minutes so added ingredients can mix together.
            Add salt according to preference</li>
<br>
        <li>Add pepper soup or banga soup spices, and cook
            for 7-10 minutes still on medium low heat. Taste
            for seasoning and adjust if needed because the
            soup is ready at this point. If you need more
            seasoning or soup/ liquids repeat step 3 until
            you achieve your desired quantity and taste.
            
        </li>
<br>
        <li>Reduce heat to simmer and add uziza leaves.
            Simmer for 3-5 minutes.
            </li>

        <li>Your food is ready!!</li>
