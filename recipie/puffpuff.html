    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cups of all-purpose Flo</li>  
      <li>2 tsp of yeast</li>
      <li>1½ tsp of ground nutmeg</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mixing the dry ingredients: Stir the flour into a clean dry bowl. Add the
            nutmeg, yeast, sugar, and salt. Mix well.</li>
<br>
        <li>Add warm water and continue to mix</li>
<br>
        <li>Cover the bowl with the plastic film or aluminum foil and place in a
            warm place to rise for 45 minutes or until it doubles in size.
            
            </li>
<br>
        <li>While waiting, cut the habanero pepper into tiny pieces and add to the
            batter. Stir very well.</li>
<br>
        <li>Put some oil into a deep pot and allow it to heat up. The oil should be at
            least 3 inches deep. This is to give room for the puff-puff to swim in the
            oil. It is not advisable to use a deep fryer for puff-puff because of the
            netting, but if you do, set the temperature to 180°C
        </li>
<br>
        <li>Test that the oil is hot enough by putting a drop of batter into the oil. If
            it sizzles and floats back to the surface, then the oil is perfectly hot. If
            the drop of batter drowns, the oil is not ready
            .</li>
<br>
        <li>When the oil is hot enough, scoop some batter with a small ice-cream
            scoop or use your hands. Put in more scoops in the pan without
            overcrowding the puff-puff, the more room there is, the better it fries.
            
        </li>
<br>
        <li>Reduce the heat to medium to avoid burning the puff puff</li>
<br>
        <li>HOnce the underside of the puff-puffs have turned golden brown, flip the
            balls so that the opposite side would be fried as well.
            </li>
<br>
        <li>Once the puff-puff is golden brown all over, take it out and place in a
            sieve lined with paper towels to absorb the oil.</li>
<br>
        <li>Eat your puff-puff warm or cool and enjoy</li>
