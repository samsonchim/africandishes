    <h2>MIYAN KUKA(BAOBAB LEAF SOUP)</h2>
    <i>"Miyan kuka is a delicacy of Hausa origin. If you have ever been to the North, you must have noticed
        some dark green powder sold in Northern markets by the traders; that is what northerners call
        Kuka. It is made from Baobab leaves. The leaves are usually dried in the sun and then grind into fine
        powder. Miyan kuka is also called Luru soup".</i>

      <li>1 pc medium sized smoked
        black catfish (dried fish)</li>
      <li>½ kg assorted meat</li>
      <li>2 tbsp kuka (baobob) powder</li>
      <li>1 tbsp ginger powder</li>
      <li>1 tbsp garlic powder</li>
      <li>1 pc small onion (finely
        chopped)</li>
      <li>2 oz palm oil</li>
      <li>2 seasoning cubes</li>
      <li>1 cup water</li>
      <li>3 tbsp locust beans</li>
      <li>1 tbsp ground crayfish
    </li>
      <li>½ tbsp dry pepper</li>
      <li>1 tbsp salt (or by preference)</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash the assorted meat and smoked fish (dried fish.)</li>
<br>
        <li>Put the meat into a pot and season properly. Also add the powdered ginger and garlic. Add
            water and cook until the meat is tender.</li>
<br>
        <li>Once cooked, separate the meat stock</li>
<br>
        <li>In a separate pot, heat up the oil and fry the onion. Gently add the meat stock to the oil. Add
        the washed dried fish and more water if you desire. Cook for 5 minutes to get the seasoning
        into the fish</li>
<br>
        <li>Add crayfish, pepper, seasoning and locust bean to the boiling pot of meat stock and dried
            fish. Allow to simmer</li>
<br>
        <li>Take out the fish from the pot. The essence of taking out the fish is so you can have enough
            space to whisk the kuka so that you don’t end up with a lumpy soup. But, if you are sure you
            can whisk it properly with the fish in there, then there is no need to take it out.
            </li>
<br>

        <li>Sieve the kuka powder into a bowl before adding it to the pot. You are advised to add the
            powder with your hand: a little at a time and whisk consistently until you end up with a lump
            free consistency. You can add more water if the soup is too thick.</li>
<br>
        <li>Allow to cook for about 3 minutes.</li>
<br>
        <li>Add the fish, meat, and salt to taste. Allow to simmer.</li>
<br>
        <li>Your soup is ready. Serve and enjoy your meal.</li>
