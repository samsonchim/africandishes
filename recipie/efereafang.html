    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Wash goat meat, (or your meat of choice) cow
            skin, stockfish and put in a pot. Add salt, pepper,
            sliced onions and 2 cubes of seasoning. Stir and
            put to boil. Don’t add water. Allow the meat to
            cook in its own juice for enhanced flavor. When
            the stock is almost dried up, add a cup of water
            and continue cooking till the meat are tender. Add
            the dryfish and cook for another 2 minutes.</li>
<br>
        <li>Add palm oil, diced yellow and red pepper, salt
            and seasoning cubes to the boiling meat. Add
            crayfish and the waterleaf, stir and allow to steam
            for about 5 minutes. Add your afang and stir. Turn
            off the heat. You don’t want to overcook the
            vegetables so that they stay fresh and green. Mind
            you, residual heat continues to cook the soup for a
            few minutes.</li>
<br>
        <li>Stir again and your afang soup is ready. Serve
            with your swallow of choice eg. fufu, pounded
            yam, garri, or semovita.</li>
