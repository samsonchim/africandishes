    <h2>ASUN:
        PEPPERED
        GOAT MEAT</h2>
    <i>Finger-licking and lip-smacking, Asun is
        smoked and spicy goat meat and skin sauteed in
        a variety of spices. Goat meat is a lot healthier
        than beef. It has more protein and iron and is
        lower in calories. Although goat meat can be
        tough to work with, it brings its own unique
        savory flavours if cooked properly. Asun is
        marinated in spices based on preferences and
        the meat and skin is usually cut into bite-sized
        chunks for easy chewing.
