    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the beef, rinse, and place in a pot. Season with
            salt and stock cubes. Add the diced onions and the
            red chilli flakes. Leave to boil for about 20 to 30
            minutes depending on how tender you want the
            meat to be.
        </li>
<br>
        <li>Once the meat is almost done, add the stockfish and
            cook for 5 minutes until soft.</li>
<br>
        <li>Blend the ogbono seeds and add it to the boiling
            meat. Be sure you have enough stock in the pot. You
            need about four cups of stock to start with. Stir very
            well until the ogbono is well dissolved in the stock
            </li>
<br>
        <li>Turn down the heat and add your leafy greens. Leave
            to simmer for another 2 to 3 minutes.
            </li>
<br>
        <li>Serve with your favourite bolus food like eba, amala,
            and pounded yam. ENJOY!

<section class="Tips">
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ogbono soup gets thicker as it stays. So if you plan
            on not serving this immediately, you can add a little
            more extra stock or water</li>
        <li>Palm oil is an essential part of this meal so you can
            increase or reduce the quantity you use. It all
            depends on your personal preference.</li>
        <li>Ideally, ugwu leaves are stirred in at the final stage
            of cooking this soup, but you can use any other leafy
            greens. I will strongly suggest you use a strong leafy
            green alternative like kale or collard greens,
            especially if the stew will last you more than a day.
            You can also add okra in place of the leafy green if
            preferred.</li>
        <li>I added red pepper flakes for some real heat. You
            can also use cayenne pepper, minced habanero or
            simply skip the heat if you donâ€™t like it.
            </li>
    </ul>
