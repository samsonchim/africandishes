    <h2>Chapati</h2>
    <i>"Chapati is unleavened flat bread adopted from the 
        Indian Rotti. It was first introduced to Kenya during 
        colonial times as the Indian laborers constructed the 
        railroads throughout East Africa. For many Kenyans at 
        the time, Chapati was seen as part of a desirable 
        modern meal. After decades of integration, Kenyan 
        Chapati has become a more layered and thicker version 
        of Indian Rotti. Today, Kenyans prepare Chapati as part
         of a celebratory meal or to welcome special guests.

      <li>3 cups wheat flour </li>
      <li>1Â½ cups warm water</li>
      <li>2 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>5-6 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>The rind of one lemon - grated</li>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl add flour and salt. Incorporate the grated
            lemon rind to the flour, followed by 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil and mix well.
            </li>
<br>
        <li>Make a hole in the middle of the flour mixture; 
            add the warm water and start kneading until the 
            water has been absorbed.</li>
<br>
        <li>Knead the mixture for 5-10 minutes and add flour if needed, 
            until the dough is non-sticky on your bowl and hands.</li>
            <br>
        <li>Add 2-3 tablespoons of vegetable oil and continue 
            kneading until the oil mixes well and the dough feels soft. </li>
<br>       

<li>Cover the dough and leave it to rest for 20-30 minutes.</li>
<br>     

<li>On a smooth flat surface, roll out the kneaded dough using a rolling pin 
    (make sure the surface is dusted with flour)</li>
<br>

<li>After completely stretching it out, divide it into 8 straight strips using a sharp knife. 
    Coil each of the strips to form a ball- like shape</li>
<br>

<li>Dust the flat surface with more flour and take one of the balls and roll 
    it out using a rolling pin to a flat circular shape.</li>
<br>


<li>Repeat this process to the rest of the remaining balls.</li>
<br>

<li>On a hot pan, place the rolled out circular Chapati and fry (using medium heat) each side with a little bit of vegetable oil until its golden brown. Place your cooked Chapati on a flat plate and cover with aluminum foil or store them in a hot pot. 
    Repeat this step with the rest of the remaining coiled dough.</li>
