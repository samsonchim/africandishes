    <h2>Mahamri</h2>
    <i>"Mahamri is a type of doughnut incorporating special 
        ingredients such as coconut milk and cardamom. 
        This authentic type of snack originated from the 
        Swahili coastal regions of Kenya and Tanzania and is 
        still very popular in both regions.
        Normally, it is eaten at breakfast, accompanied by 
        Kenyan Chai (milk tea). " </i>

    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a mixing bowl add flour, sugar, yeast and Cardamom, 
            butter/margarine, and the egg. Mix the ingredients together
            with either clean hands or a spatula. Slowly add 
            coconut milk, a little at a time, as you knead the dough.
            </li>
<br>
        <li>Knead the dough, for a minimum of 15-20 minutes until it 
            is soft, smooth and 
            not sticky in either your hands or the mixing bowl</li>
<br>
        <li>Place the dough in a container and cover it with either a 
            lid or a clean cloth. Let it rest and rise for at least 3-4
             hours at room temperature. (You can choose to 
            leave it overnight, the dough should double in size)</li>
            <br>
        <li>Using a dough cutter or knife, divide the dough into 4-5 
            equal balls and coat each of the dough with flour, cover them 
            again with a clean cloth for 15 minutes and let them rise. </li>
<br>       

<li>Sprinkle some flour on a clean flat surface and using a 
    rolling pin, roll each ball of dough into a circle of about 
    6 inches. Use more flour to dust the rolling surface to 
    prevent the dough 
    from sticking on the surface and on the rolling pin</li>
<br>     

<li>Cut each of the dough circles into 4 pieces.</li>
<br>

<li>Heat the vegetable oil in a frying pan or a wok.</li>
<br>

<li>Test your oil by gently dropping a small piece of dough 
    into the oil. If the dough stays at the bottom for a couple of seconds then rises to the surface, your oil is ready for frying. If it rises up immediately, then your oil is too hot and you will need to reduce the heat to avoid burning 
    your Mahamris and having the inside undercooked..</li>
<br>


<li>Fry 4 Mahamris at a time (depending on the size of your 
    pan or wok). Use your metal strainer to splash oil over 
    the top of the Mahamris to help them puff up. As soon as 
    you see the bottom side of the Mahamris 
    has turned light-gold brown, turn them over..</li>
<br>

<li>Keep turning the Mahamris until they have a nice 
    golden-brown color on both sides. Remove them from the 
    hot oil and place them in a serving plate lined with paper 
    towels to absorb any excess oil.</li>
<br>

<li>Repeat this process until all the dough pieces have been fried</li>
