    <h2>Ugali</h2>
    <i>"Ugali is the most common staple food in Kenya. 
        It is a polenta-like dish, made from maize, millet or 
        sorghum flour, added to boiling water and cooked until 
        it becomes a dense block. It is usually eaten with meat 
        stew, Nyama Choma (Roasted beef or mutton) or most 
        commonly with Sukuma Wiki (cooked kale). 
        It is a well-known energy-giving and body-building food.
